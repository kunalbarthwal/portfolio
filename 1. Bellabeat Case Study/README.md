# Bellabeat Data Analysis Case Study

**We followed a six step analysis process**

**Tools** - SQL (BigQuery), Spreadsheets and Tableau


## Step 1 - ASK 
* In this step, we will define the Business Task and identify stakeholders.
* **Business Task** - Analyze smart device user data in order to gain insights into how customers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then apply these insights to Bellabeat Leaf.
* **Stakeholders** - CEO, Co-founders and Marketing Analytics Team

## Step 2 - PREPARE
* In this step, we will identify data sources.
* **Data Source** - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>
* Data is well organized, with the option of both wide and long data.
* The data is reliable and is anonymized.

## Step 3 - PROCESS
* In this step, we will perform data cleaning/manipulation.
* The data cleaning process included removing duplicates, fixing incorrect formats and handling missing data.
* We will verify data integrity via conditional formatting and data validation.

## Step 4 - ANALYZE
* The data contains metrics such as calories, steps, intensity, etc. which can be used to provide basic goals/targets in the app/watch interface.
* Lightly active distance represents a large amount of total active distance.
* Sedentary minutes represents more than 50%  of the total active minutes.
* On an average, 15.8% of the time, the device was inactive (charging or device not worn)
* We deduced metrics such as Max BPM - 200+, Min BPM - 37, Average Max BPM - 171.28 , Average Min BPM - 46.57. These can be used to set up alerts for Upper and lower limit of BPM, as per critical medical conditions.
* Individuals are most active from 5-7 PM, on an average.
* Individuals have highest METs (Metabolic Equivalents) between 9-11 AM and 6-7 PM. Metabolic Equivalents (METs) are a great way to assess the general fitness of an individual.
* Average sleep record was 1.1 in a day.
* Most of the individuals are sleeping less than 8 hours a day. 
* According to the sleep value ID, most individuals are in the ASLEEP ZONE when they are in bed, with a few individuals alternating between ASLEEP and RESTLESS ZONES.
* Most people prefer automatic report generation, accounting for more than 50% of the reports generated.

## Step 5 - SHARE
* We will now create data visualizations using Tableau.
* Then, we will draft an effective presentation for our meeting with the stakeholders.

## Step 6 - ACT
* Based on our analysis, there are plenty of parameters that can be utilized effectively to create new features and increase device/app interaction.
* We can apply these insights by creating new features, alerts such as vibrations/app notifications for critical health features/personal targets and health scores to attract customers.
* Stakeholders can collaborate with R&D and marketing team to develop and test new features.
